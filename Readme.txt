README

The code is really simple to use. Just compile it like this:
    javac Main.java

And run it like this:
    java Main DirectoryOfFiles

It has been tested with +1.25GB of data.
For a bigger dataset, it might give memory problems. In this
case, an implementation to save the temporal data in disk
would be better. A parallel implementation would also be better
in that case, for a better performance.
